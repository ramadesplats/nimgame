- The Nim game project is a project I did during the "Functionnal programming course".
- After consideration of the concept, different rules and versions of "Nim game", I chose one environment to develop the game. An environment you can find in the "implementation.txt".
- I then had to develop the different classes specific to the game such as, the different moves, the different stats of the game and the artificial intelligence.
- All of this, considering the optimisation problematics, GUI and parallelize.
